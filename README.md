# MathematischeAlgorithmenSS2022


The goal of this course is, to implement a performant graph library



## GRAPH FORMAT

graph example folder: `./src/graph_library/example_graphs`

First line: Number of nodes; following lines: Edges (i->j, numbering: 0 ... node-count-1) (To check your algorithms: Graphs 2 and 3 each have 4 context components, the large 222, the whole-large 9560, and the whole-large 306).
